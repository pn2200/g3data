    * g3data/main.c : Added error bar options to gui.
    If x and/or y error bars are selected, the cursor draws symmetric errors
    just after the data point is created. Thus, clicking again defines the errors.

    * g3data/main.c : Added optional asymmetric error bars.
    If the error bars are selected to be asymmetric, only the first half is defined
    by the second click. A third click completely defines the error bars.
    Note that with logarithmic axes and error bars, the error bars are automatically 
    assumed to be asymmetric. 

    * g3data/points.c : Added printing of errors depending on how many and the type 
    of errors defined.

    * g3data/drawing.c (DrawErrorBar) : Added function to draw error bar.

    * g3data/strings.h : Added some labels for errors and changed "Include errors" 
    to "Include digitization errors" in order to distinguish them from error bars.

    * AUTHORS : Added some authors
